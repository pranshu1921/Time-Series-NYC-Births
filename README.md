# Time-Series-NYC-Births

The project deals with applying time series data in R on a dataset for decomposing the **seasonal time series, forecasting** using **Exponential Smoothing** and using **ARIMA** to address issues of correlations between successive values of time series on data of **number of births per month in New York city, from January 1946 to December 1959**.

## General info

The project consists of two parts – 

Part A – involves decomposing seasonal time series data and subtracting that effect from data for seasonal adjustments.

Part B – addresses the issues of correlations between successive values of the time series, make a better predictive model by addressing autocorrelation issues using ARIMA for irregular components.

Refer to the report for more information.
